/**

 * <p>Triggered when the body or comment of an issue or pull request includes a URL that matches a
 * configured content reference domain. Only GitHub Apps can receive this event. GitHub Apps that have
 * the <code>content_references</code> <code>write</code> permission and subscribe to the
 * <code>content_reference</code> event receive this webhook event when a new content reference is
 * <code>created</code>. See "<a href="/apps/using-content-attachments/">Using content attachments</a>"
 * to learn more about content references and attachments.</p>
 *
 * <p>Webhook events are triggered based on the specificity of the domain you register. For example, if
 * you register a subdomain (<code>https://subdomain.example.com</code>) then only URLs for the
 * subdomain trigger this event. If you register a domain (<code>https://example.com</code>) then URLs
 * for domain and all subdomains trigger this event. See "<a
 * href="/v3/apps/installations/#create-a-content-attachment">Create a content attachment</a>" to
 * create a new content attachment.</p>
