/**

 * <p>Triggered when someone revokes their authorization of a GitHub App. A GitHub App receives this
 * webhook by default and cannot unsubscribe from this event. This event is not available in the <a
 * href="/v3/activity/events/">Events API</a>.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Anyone can revoke their authorization of a GitHub App from their <a
 * href="https://github.com/settings/apps/authorizations">GitHub account settings page</a>. Revoking
 * the authorization of a GitHub App does not uninstall the GitHub App. You should program your GitHub
 * App so that when it receives this webhook, it stops calling the API on behalf of the person who
 * revoked the token. If your GitHub App continues to use a revoked access token, it will receive the
 * <code>401 Bad Credentials</code> error.
 * For details about user-to-server requests, which require GitHub App authorization, see "<a
 * href="/apps/building-github-apps/identifying-and-authorizing-users-for-github-apps/">Identifying and
 * authorizing users for GitHub Apps</a>."</p>
 * Used by:
