/**
 * Authenticating as an installation lets you perform actions in the API for that installation.
 * Before authenticating as an installation, you must create an installation access token. These
 * installation access tokens are used by GitHub Apps to authenticate.
 *
 * By default, installation access tokens are scoped to all the repositories that an installation
 * can access. You can limit the scope of the installation access token to specific repositories
 * by using the repository_ids parameter. See the Create a new installation token endpoint for more
 * details. Installation access tokens have the permissions configured by the GitHub App and expire
 * after one hour.
 *
 * To create an installation access token, include the JWT generated above in the Authorization
 * header in the API request:
 *
 * curl -i -X POST \
 * -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT" \
 * -H "Accept: application/vnd.github.machine-man-preview+json" \
 * https://api.github.com/app/installations/:installation_id/access_tokens
